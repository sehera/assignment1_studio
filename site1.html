    <div class="one"> the real work of borders is mostly psychological  .</div>

    <div class="two"> the world that has insisted on separation, </div>
    <div class="three"> dividing communities along lines </div>
    <div class="four"> I physically find myself on the other side of the line, struggling to keep my memories afloat. </div>

    <div class="five"> Respecting borders and boundaries, while building bridges  </div>
    <div class="six"> in solidarity with </div>
      <div class="six2"> their struggle, acts of defiance and resilient spirit. </div>

    <div class="seven"> a theme repeated throughout Creation, both of the world and of man and woman. </div>
    <div class="eight">instead see and uplift the humanity and rights of individuals. </div>

    <div class="nine">light and darkness, day and night, sea and land, animals and human beings. </div>
    <div class="ten"> Where borders are drawn, power is exercised. </div>

    <div class="eleven">living within boundaries, some of which are marked and physical, while others are </div>
    <div class="eleven2">cognitive and implied. </div>
    <div class="twelve"> time to rethink the importance we give to arbitrary lines on a map. </div>

    <div class="thirteen"> Two distinct spaces that in reality had declared war on one another, and yet </div>
    <div class="thirteen2">  here they were in front of me, indistinguishable </div>
    <div class="fourteen">imposing arbitrary geo-political boundaries </div>

  <div class="fifteen">  communities are in a tug of war with themselves and with each other, creating </div>
  <div class="fifteen2">  boundaries, pushing the limits of borders </div>

  <div class="sixteen">In the midst of turmoil, disbelief and fear,</div>

  <div class="eighteen">an indispensable barrier to separate people who are deemed to have a right to </div>
     <div class="eighteen2">travel the world from people who are not. </div>


  <div class="nineteen"> show this world to those of us who benefit the most, those of us not forced up </div>
  <div class="nineteen2">against the walls of this life. </div>
  <div class="twenty"> how much indignity or suffering is involved in the process.</div>



  <div class="twentyone">the violence that accompanied colonisation and the imposition of Eurocentric  </div>
  <div class="twentyone2"> political identities  remains present at borders today. </div>
  <div class="twentytwo">  the world came into being through a series of divisions </div>


  <div class="twentythree">movement and fragmented time within the grid. </div>
  <div class="twentyfour">real people trying to succeed; instead,</div>
    <div class="twentyfour2"> conversation dominated by criminality and punishment. </div>


  <div class="twentyfive"> boundaries and barriers consistent with her personal history of repression and resilience.</div>
  <div class="twentysix"> exclusion for anyone deemed unworthy to traverse the planet at will.</div>

  <div class="twentyseven">a tug of war with themselves and with each other. </div>
  <div class="twentyeight"> regulating human mobility. </div>
<div class="twentyeight2">  Borders are not immutable. </div>

  <div class="twentynine">structures inform our opinions of people and subsequently how we treat or mistreat them.  </div>
  <div class="thirty"> Separation is intrinsic. The divine process.</div>
    <div class="thirtyone"> little choice but to turn to dehumanising alternatives. </div>

  <div class="thirtytwo">carved out a personal space among these impersonal, prefabricated buildings, </div>

<div class="thirtyfour">regularly risk imprisonment or death to try and cross them.</div>
<div class="thirtyfive"> the line between us and them. </div>


<div class="thirtysix"> people to mere caricatures of danger or otherness. Death is an inevitable and </div>
<div class="thirtysix2"> sometimes deliberate outcome </div>

<div class="thirtyseven">Again and again they fail.</div>
<div class="thirtyeight">today’s turbulent times</div>
<div class="thirtyseven2">consistency is the dehumanisation of all those who interact with them.</div>

<div class= "idea"> Concept: As the viewers cursor touches the web page the grids become visible. Emphasizing the interaction of people and borders, <br>
  that is also done through the censorship of text or the blocking, as soon as the cursor comes into contact with the text. What we interact with <br>
  when borders are in play often gets silenced. Either it be news, awareness, facts or the people themselves. <br> <br>
